     * catching any errors that occur during verification and returning false instead
     * of allowing the exception to propagate.
     *
     * The process is as follows:
     * 1. The `bitcoinjs-message.verify` function is called with the message, address,
     *    and signature provided in Base64 encoding.
     * 2. If the verification is successful, the method returns true.
     * 3. If any error occurs during the verification, the method catches the error
     *    and returns false, signaling an unsuccessful verification.

     * @param message The Bitcoin message to be verified.

     * @param signatureBase64 The Base64 encoded signature corresponding to the message.
     * @return boolean Returns true if the message is successfully verified, otherwise false.
